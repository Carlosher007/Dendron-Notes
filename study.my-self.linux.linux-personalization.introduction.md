## Read this first

For this course, I will use _Parrot OS Security Edition_ using _Virtual box_

**The following sections will have in mind that you already have parrot installed os in virtual box.**

### To take into account in virtual box

When you initialize a virtual machine in virtual, before starting it you have to do this things to ensure that you will have a good experience:

- Virtual machine settings -> General -> Advanced -> Shared Clipboard -> Bidirectional
- Virtual machine settings -> General -> Advanced -> Drag'n'Drop -> Bidirectional
- Virtual machine settings -> Network -> Atached to -> Bridged Adapter

Now, go to [[study.my-self.linux.linux-personalization.personalization.first-step]] to start with the course.
